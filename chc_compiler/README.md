# chc-public-release
This repository accompanies our paper "Arbitrarily Parallelizable Code: A Model of Computation", submitted for consideration at ACM TACO.
chc is an experimental compiler that generates multithreaded code at compile time, based on a new model of computation. Code in this repository is experimental and represents a prototype implementation: we make no assurances about the quality of the code or the generated executables.
